## Sign Your Work and DCO

To improve tracking of who did what, we require a "sign-off" on all commits. This certifies that you have the rights to submit your code under the AGPL-3.0 license.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

### How to Sign Off
To sign off a commit, add the `-s` flag to your commit command:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: my change"
```
This will automatically append `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>` to your commit message.
